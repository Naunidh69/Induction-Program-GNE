## Day 1 (30/07/2025)
### This was the first day I entered the college as a student. The day was divine, as it started with shabad kirtan in the college gurudwara. Tea and snacks were served after an ardaas was made for the well being of the students.                         
### At 10 AM we were taken to the auditorium where the college staff congratulated us for entering a new phase in our lives. The college introduced us to the faculty and the various clubs and societies, which are run in coordination with teachers and students.

### The day was amazing as I saw many new faces filled with enthusiasm. Made many new friends on the very first day

### The day was wrapped up after we were given a tour of the college by the teachers.

### This is the day I would never ever forget in my life.

##Day2 -6
###I explored the campus further with my friends. The areas that I liked the most were the sports complex and the swimming pool, as I play many sports and want to explore swimming during my college time. From day 2 to day 6 of the Induction Program, many guests gave lectures to prepare for the new phase of our lives. One guest lecturer who touched my heart was Mr Manpreet Singh (A fitness coach) to never touch drugs, as this is the most volatile stage of our lives. This is the line I am gonna remember for my life. The Teacher and seniors of the college are guiding me
