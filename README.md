## Day 1 (30/07/2025)
### This was the first day I entered the college as a student. The day was divine, as it started with shabad kirtan in the college gurudwara. The calm and composing kirtan gave me a relief from nervousness I was feeling. Tea and snacks were served after an ardaas was made for the well being of the students.                         
### At 10 AM we were taken to the auditorium where the college staff congratulated us for entering a new phase in our lives. The college introduced us to the faculty and the various clubs and societies, which are run in coordination with teachers and students.

### The day was amazing as I saw many new faces filled with enthusiasm. Made many new friends on the very first day

### The day was wrapped up after we were given a tour of the college by the teachers.

### This is the day I would never ever forget in my life.

## Day2 - 6
### During my time at college so far, I had the chance to explore the campus further with my friends. The areas I liked the most were the sports complex and the swimming pool, as I enjoy playing various sports and would love to take up swimming during my college years.

### From Day 2 to Day 6 of the Induction Program, several guest speakers delivered insightful lectures to help us prepare for this new chapter in our lives. One speaker who truly left a lasting impression on me was Mr. Manpreet Singh, a fitness coach. His powerful message about staying away from drugs during this critical and vulnerable phase of life is something I will always remember.

### Another speaker I enjoyed was Mr. Lakhvir Singh, the Head of the Centre for Multifaceted Learning. He kept the vibe light and fun throughout his session, which made it really enjoyable. He encouraged us to join the Centre, saying it would help in the holistic development of students. Iâ€™m genuinely interested in joining it and exploring what it has to offer.

### I also feel grateful to the teachers and seniors who are constantly guiding and supporting me as I settle into college life.
