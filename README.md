## Day 1 (30/07/2025)
### This was the first day I was entring the college as a student. The day was divine as it was started with shabad kirtan in the college gurudwara saheb. Tea and snacks were served after an ardaas was made for the well being of the students.                         
### At 10 AM we were taken to the auditorium where the college staff congratulated us for entring a new phase in our life. The college introduced us with faculty and the various clubs and societies run by the coordination of Teacher and students.

### The day was amazing as I saw many new faces filled with enthusiasam. Made many new friends on the very first day

### The day was wrapped up after we were given the tour of college by the teachers.

### This is the day I would never ever forget in my life.
